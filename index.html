        <h1>Nearby Cities: Bellevue</h1>
            <p>As a long-term resident of the Bellevue area, I've always been fond of the locales it has and what it can offer people, even if they're just tourists on their way to Seattle. Bellevue offers much more down-to-earth attractions compared to Seattle or Olympia, along with areas perfect for those who lack access to cars or other form of long-distance transportation. Each area on this list is accessible by city bus.</p>

            <p>Established within South Bellevue in 1992, the Bellevue Botanical Garden houses dozens of different plant species within its grounds. For those who want to enjoy the wilderness the Pacific Northwest has to offer from the safety of a controlled environment, this is the place. Worth noting is the Yao Garden, a section dedicated to the relationship between Yao Japan and Bellevue, housing numerous Japanese plant species and other flora from East Asia.</p>
